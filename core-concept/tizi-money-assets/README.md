TDs are rebase tokens, fully collateralised with assets that can be instantly converted into USDC. A rebase token can experience Profit (positive rebase) when the collateral value exceeds 100% and Loss (negative rebase) when the collateral value falls below 100%. Please note that you assume the risk of all protocols in the Collateral. Profit payouts occur through daily rebasing, providing transparent balance and P/L visibility.
