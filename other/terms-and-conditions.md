# Terms and conditions

These Terms of Service and any terms and conditions incorporated herein by reference (collectively, the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Interface. You must read the Terms carefully.

Welcome to [https://tizi.money](https://tizi.money/), a website-hosted user interface (the “Interface”) provided by Tizi (“we”, “us” or “our”). The Interface offers access to a decentralized protocol, known as “Tizi,” which enables users to mint and redeem TD and TLT, pegged 1:1 to USDC (the “Protocol”).

The terms "you", "your", and "user(s)" refer to anyone who accesses or uses the interface in any manner. If you are accessing or using the interface on behalf of a company or legal entity (e.g. your employer), you warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms. In that case, "you", "your", or "user(s)" will refer to that entity.

By accessing, browsing or otherwise using the _Interface_, or by acknowledging agreement to the Terms on the _Interface_, you agree that you have read, understood and accepted all of the Terms and our Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”), which is incorporated by reference into the Terms.

IMPORTANT: PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU ASSUME THE RISK OF ALL PROTOCOLS IN THE COLLATERAL OF OUR PRODUCTS

IMPORTANT: BY USING OR ACCESSING THE INTERFACE, YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES WITH TIZI THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF IN COURT, AND TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A CLASS ACTION, BOTH OF WHICH AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS IN RESOLVING DISPUTES.

We reserve the right to modify or revise these terms at any time, in our sole discretion. The updated terms will be available on the interface and the "Last Updated" date will be updated accordingly. Please periodically check for changes. Your continued use of the interface after the updates are made constitutes your acceptance of the new terms. If you do not agree to the revised terms, you should stop accessing or using the interface.

#### 1.  Eligibility

To use the interface, you must meet the eligibility requirements. You represent and warrant, for the benefit of Tizi and its affiliates, that you meet these requirements on each date you use or benefit from the interface:

* you are not a citizen of, located in, incorporated in, or otherwise have a registered office in (I) the United States of America (an “American”) or (II) Cuba, Iran, Myanmar (Burma), North Korea, China, Syria, the regions of Crimea, Donetsk or Luhansk, or any other country or region that is the subject of comprehensive country-wide or region-wide economic sanctions by the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, or the European Union (collectively, “Sanctioned Territories”).

* you are not a person listed on any of the following lists (each a Sanctions List): the Consolidated United Nations Security Council Sanctions List; the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, or the Sectoral Sanctions Identification List maintained by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC); or on the European Commission’s consolidated list of Restrictive measures in force or any similar list maintained by, or public announcement of sanctions made by any Sanctions Authority (defined below);

The utilization of a virtual private network (VPN) or any other methods by restricted individuals to access or use the interface is strictly prohibited and may result in legal consequences for fraudulent usage of the interface.

#### 2. Assumption of Risk

By accessing and using the Interface, you represent that you are financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets such as so-called stablecoins, and other digital tokens such as those following the Ethereum Token Standard (ERC-20).

In particular, you understand that the markets for these digital assets are nascent and highly volatile due to risk factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You understand that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens.

So-called stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be, may not be fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics and runs. Further, you understand that smart contract transactions automatically execute and settle, and that blockchain-based transactions are irreversible when confirmed. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems are variable and may increase dramatically at any time.

Finally, you understand that we do not create, own, or operate cross-chain bridges and we do not make any representation or warranty about the safety or soundness of any cross-chain bridge, including its use for Tizi.

In summary, you acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the Interface. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Interface to interact with the Protocol.

Under no circumstances shall we or any of our officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to you for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including (but not limited to) damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible property, arising out of or relating to any access to or use of the Interface, nor will we be responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access to or use of the Interface, or from any access to or use of any information obtained by any unauthorized access to or use of the Interface.

#### 9. Access to the Interface

We reserve the right to revoke access to the interface if there is a breach of the terms, including failure to meet the eligibility requirements.

We will not be responsible for any losses or damages you may incur due to the inaccessibility of the interface at any time or for any reason.

#### 10. Dispute Resolution

You and Tizi agree to attempt resolving any potential disputes through good faith negotiations before resorting to formal dispute resolution. If a potential dispute arises, you must contact us by sending an email to ovnstable@gmail.com so that we can attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute resolution. If a resolution cannot be reached within 60 days of a dispute being reported, it must be resolved through arbitration administered by the London Court of International Arbitration under the LCIA Arbitration Rules. The arbitration must be held confidentially and in English before a single arbitrator and cannot consolidate claims from multiple parties. Any ruling from the arbitrator can be entered in any court of the Cayman Islands or another court with jurisdiction agreed to in writing by Tizi. The Interface is considered to be based in the Cayman Islands and its availability in other jurisdictions does not establish general or specific jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands.

#### 11. Entire Agreement

These Terms, along with any additional terms, rules and conditions posted on the Tizi website, including the Privacy Policy, make up the complete agreement regarding the use of the Interface and override any previous agreements, whether written or verbal.
