# Withdraw

Users can redeem their TD for USDC using a 1:1 exchange rate (a fee may apply) by connecting their wallet at https://tizi.money

If the liquid reserve on the Base chain is insufficient to cover the withdrawal, an NFT representing the userâ€™s position in the withdrawal queue is minted instead. This NFT can then be burned for USDC once assets are rebalanced. In normal conditions we expect all withdrawals to be fulfilled within 24 hours.
